**Caesar Cipher Overview**
**Task:** Create a Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher. Users input a message and a shift value to encrypt or decrypt.

**What is the Caesar Cipher Algorithm?**
The Caesar Cipher is an ancient encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who used it to protect military communications. 
It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. 
For instance, a shift of 6 turns 'A' into 'G', 'B' into 'H', and so on. This type of substitution Cipher laid the groundwork for modern cryptography.

**How it Works:**
To demonstrate, let's encrypt your name "Sharon" with a shift of 4.

- Write down the plaintext: **Sharon**
- Choose a shift value: 4
- Shift each letter by 4 positions:
   - S becomes W
   - H becomes L
   - A becomes E
   - R becomes V
   - O becomes S
   - N becomes R

The encrypted message becomes: **WLEVSR**
Now, to decrypt it:
- Using the same shift of 4, reverse the process.
- "WLEVSR" becomes **Sharon**.

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand and implement, making it great for learning encryption.
- Requires minimal shared information.
- Can be easily modified with multiple shifts or keywords to increase security.
- Low computational resource requirements.

**Disadvantages:**
- Weak security; easily cracked due to predictable patterns.
- Unsuitable for long messages.
- Provides minimal confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

**Significance in Cybersecurity Today:**
Its significance lies in being a foundational step toward developing advanced cryptographic methods. 
Today, it is an educational tool for teaching cryptographic principles to beginners.
Though no longer used in real-world applications, the Caesar Cipher played an essential role in the history of cryptography.
