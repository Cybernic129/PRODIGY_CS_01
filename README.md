Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest encryption methods, named after Julius Caesar, who used it for secure military communication. It involves shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', etc.

How it works:
•	Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by the letter that appears a fixed number of positions later in the alphabet. For example, encrypting “NICOLE” with a shift of 3 results in “QLFROH.”
•	Decryption: The process is reversed by shifting the letters back to their original positions.

Advantages:
•	Simple to use and ideal for beginners.
•	Requires minimal pre-shared information.
•	Easy to modify for more security.
•	Minimal computing resources needed.

Disadvantages:
•	Provides weak security and can be easily cracked.
•	Not suitable for encrypting long messages.
•	Lacks confidentiality and integrity.

Significance in Cybersecurity: While not used in modern applications, the Caesar Cipher played an important role in the history of cryptography. It laid the groundwork for more advanced encryption methods and is now commonly used as an educational tool to teach basic cryptographic concepts.
